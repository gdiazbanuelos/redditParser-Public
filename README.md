This a collection of my reddit parsers!
In each folder is a script.sh that executes the bot that scans
the specific subreddit for the specific game in 60 second intervals

To run the Scripts in 60 second intervals in the background:
cd into the desired subreddit bot folder, this is the 3DS example

1. $ cd 3DS_Deals_Bot
2. $ nohup ./Script_3DS.sh &
You are done! The bot will run in the background and scan every 60 seconds
